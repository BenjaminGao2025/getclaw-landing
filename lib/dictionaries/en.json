    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "q": "What is OpenClaw?",
        "a": "OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent platform created by Peter Steinberger. It can automate everyday tasks like managing emails, scheduling meetings, sending messages, and more — acting as a tireless digital assistant for busy professionals."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is OpenClaw free? Why should I pay for installation?",
        "a": "Yes, OpenClaw itself is free and open-source. However, deploying it securely requires deep technical knowledge — server configuration, network security, API integration, and ongoing maintenance. That's where we come in. Think of it like WordPress: the software is free, but you'd still hire a professional to build and secure your business website."
      },
      {
        "q": "Who pays for the server and API costs?",
        "a": "You do — and you maintain full control. We help you set up on your own infrastructure (cloud VPS or local Mac mini) and configure your own API keys. This means your data stays yours, and you only pay for what you use. Typical server costs run $20-50/month, and API costs vary based on usage."
      },
      {
        "q": "What AI models does OpenClaw support?",
        "a": "OpenClaw supports all major AI models including OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), and open-source models via Ollama. We help you choose and configure the right model mix for your use case and budget."
      },
      {
        "q": "How long does setup take?",
        "a": "Most deployments are completed within 48 hours. In-person setups in Vancouver are typically done in a single day. Remote deployments may take 1-2 business days depending on your infrastructure and requirements."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can you serve clients outside Vancouver?",
        "a": "Absolutely! While we offer premium in-person service in Vancouver, the majority of our clients are remote. We work with teams across Canada, the US, and globally via secure remote access."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does \"hardening\" mean?",
        "a": "Hardening refers to securing your OpenClaw instance against unauthorized access and attacks. This includes: enabling DM pairing authentication, locking down network ports, setting up sandboxed execution environments, configuring rate limits, and implementing proper access controls. With 42,900+ exposed instances found online, this step is critical."
      },
      {
        "q": "What happens after the 14-day hypercare period?",
        "a": "After the 14-day period, your OpenClaw instance continues running independently. You can manage it yourself with the documentation we provide, or subscribe to our Managed Care plan for ongoing monitoring, updates, security patches, and priority support."
